## Why Foton?

The Open Network (TON) development ecosystem is fast-growing and constantly evolving. With years of development, it changed radically.
As an example, the first smart contract language for TON was a low-level Fift, then it was replaced by easier-to-understand FunC.
Right now, the community is working on a high-level Tact language, which is even more user-friendly.

The situation with the JavaScript ecosystem in TON is the opposite. The long-standing libraries like `@ton/core` and `tonweb` are,
in a way, low-level. They require the deep understanding of TON blockchain and its architecture. To compose a transaction payload,
a developer needs to know what are cells and slices, how to serialize them, etc. Moreover, newcomers face the lack of the documentation
for these libraries and often ask the community for help.

Looking at the Ethereum ecosystem, we can see a real competition between the JavaScript libraries.
This competition results in the best developer experience. It started with the `web3.js` until the `ethers.js`
proved to be a better alternative. These days, the tools like [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/)
are setting standards for the blockchain JavaScript toolkits.

**Foton** is heavily inspired by Viem, and its mission is to show a new way for the TON ecosystem to create dApps!
